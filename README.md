Do Not Disturb
==============

For those who work in an open office and need a better way than headphones to indicate availability.  The light ties to Slack statuses to tell them how wary they should be to approach you.  There will be some soldering involved, and although this can be done on any OS we'll assume OSX here.

### Tips

We can't control the 'on' led, it will always be green, it will always be on and we really don't want to be giving the wrong idea that you are free to chat.  You've got a lot of options but I recommend getting some liquid electrical tape and just putting a dab of it right on top.  It's non-destructive, blends in with the black solder mask of the board and comes off in one nice chunk if you ever choose to clean it up.
